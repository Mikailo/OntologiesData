http://www.w3.org/ns/auth/acl#Append,append,"Append accesses are specific write access which only add information, and do not remove information. For text files, for example, append access allows bytes to be added onto the end of the file. For RDF graphs, Append access allows adds triples to the graph but does not remove any. Append access is useful for dropbox functionality. Dropbox can be used for link notification, which the information added is a notification that a some link has been made elsewhere relevant to the given resource."
http://www.w3.org/ns/auth/acl#AuthenticatedAgent,Anyone authenticated,"A class of agents who have been authenticated. In other words, anyone can access this resource, but not anonymously. The social expectation is that the authentication process will provide an identify and a name, or pseudonym. (A new ID should not be minted for every access: the intent is that the user is able to continue to use the ID for continues interactions with peers, and for example to develop a reputation)"

http://www.w3.org/ns/dcat#Dataset,Dataset,"A collection of data, published or curated by a single source, and available for access or download in one or more formats. This class represents the actual dataset as published by the dataset publisher. In cases where a distinction between the actual dataset and its entry in the catalog is necessary (because metadata such as modification date and maintainer might differ), the catalog record class can be used for the latter."
http://www.w3.org/ns/dcat#CatalogRecord,Catalog Record,"A record in a data catalog, describing a single dataset. This class is optional and not all catalogs will use it. It exists for catalogs where a distinction is made between metadata about a dataset and metadata about the dataset's entry in the catalog. For example, the publication date property of the dataset reflects the date when the information was originally made available by the publishing agency, while the publication date of the catalog record is the date when the dataset was added to the catalog. In cases where both dates differ, or where only the latter is known, the publication date should only be specified for the catalog record. Notice that the W3C PROV Ontology allows describing further provenance information such as the details of the process and the agent involved in a particular change to a dataset."
http://www.w3.org/ns/dcat#Distribution,Distribution,"Represents a specific available form of a dataset. Each dataset might be available in different forms, these forms might represent different formats of the dataset or different endpoints. Examples of distributions include a downloadable CSV file, an API or an RSS feed. This represents a general availability of a dataset it implies no information about the actual access method of the data, i.e. whether it is a direct download, API, or some through Web page. The use of dcat:downloadURL property indicates directly downloadable distributions."
